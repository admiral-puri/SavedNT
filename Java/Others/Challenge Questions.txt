1) Write a Java program to find where a number is prime number or not.

2) Write a Java program to find where a number is an armstrong number or not.

3) Implement Bubble Sort in Java.

4) Implement circular queue using an array.

5) Implement Merge Sort on array of secondary type.

6) Accept a value as command line argument. Find the next prime number to that value.
(hint : int x = Integer.parseInt(args[0]); )

7) Make an matrix of size 3x3. Fill it with random numbers. Display  it, transpose it and display it.

8) Make a class StudentResult with name and marks of 3 subjects and average.
Create 2 objects.
Use parameterized constructor to initialize the objects with name and marks. 
Calculate average in the constructor itself from the given marks.
Make a display method to output the student result.

9) Create a Binary Search Tree in Java.
It must have create() and inorder() methods.
Implement recursive inorder.
Define a derived class D_BST.
It overrides the inorder() and provides non 
recursive definition.

From main() call a test() method that
takes super class reference to accept
object of BST and of D_BST.
In test() call create and inorder.
Study the executing methods. 


10) Create 2 arrays of size 1000.
Fill them with random numbers.
Create 2 threads to sort the two arrays using bubble sort and quick sort.
Find the time required to sort in milliseconds.
Print Statistics.

11) Write a Java program to count the number of vowels in a text file.

12) Write a Java program to copy a folder to a target location. Dedicate one thread per file to be copied.

13) Write a Java program to detect a USB drive as it is connected.
