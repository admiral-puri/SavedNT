Q) What happens if an object is outputted using System.out.println method?
A) Known that every class is by default a sub class of the class Object.
The class Object defines a method : public String toString()
It gets auto invoked on print.
The inherited definition returns a String of lesser meaning.
But if overridden then the method can return a value meaningfull and corresponding to the class.
