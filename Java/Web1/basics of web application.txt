WebServer-Web Client Interaction
--------------------------------
The client sends an HTTP request to the
web server. 
The web server receives and converts the 
request into an HTTPServletRequest object. 

This object is delivered to a web component, 
which can interact with JavaBeans components 
or a database to generate dynamic content. 

The web component can then generates
a HTTPServletResponse object.

Or it can pass the request to another 
web component, eventually a web component 
generates a HTTPServletResponse object. 

The web server converts this object to 
HTTP response and returns it to the client.

Servlets and JSP
-----------------
Servlets are Java programming language
classes that dynamically process requests
and construct responses. 

JSP pages are text-based documents 
that execute as servlets but allow a more
natural approach for generating web content. 

Servlets and JSP pages can be used interchangeably.

Web Application Deployment Descriptor
---------------------------------
Certain aspects of web application 
behavior can be configured when the 
application is deployed.

The configuration information is maintained
in a text file in XML format.
The file is called as web application 
deployment descriptor(DD).

Web Application
----------------
web application = {servlets, jsps, images, css, javascripts, html, java classes, videos, ..., deployment descriptor}

A web application consists of web 
components, static resource files 
such as html, images, and helper classes 
and libraries. 

The process for creating, deploying, 
and executing a web application can be 
summarized as follows:

1. Develop the web component code.
2. Develop the web application deployment descriptor.
3. Compile the web application components
   and helper classes referenced by the components.
4. Optionally package the application into a deployable unit.
5. Deploy the application into a web container.
6. Access a URL that references the web application.
