Multicasting
--------------
In computer networking, multicasting is the 
delivery of a message or information to 
a group of destination computers simultaneously 
in a single transmission from the source 
creating copies automatically if the topology of 
the network requires it.


A MulticastSocket is useful for sending and 
receiving IP multicast packets. 

A MulticastSocket is a (UDP like) DatagramSocket, 
with additional capabilities for joining 
"groups" of multicast hosts on the network. 

A multicast group is specified by a class D IP 
address and by a standard UDP port number. 

Class D IP addresses are in the range 
224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255, inclusive. 

The address 224.0.0.0 is reserved and 
should not be used.
