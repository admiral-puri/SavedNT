Java
-------
What is Java?
Java is an Object Oriented and a Platform
Independent programming language.


Object Oriented Programming
-------------------------------
OOP is a programming paradigm that uses concepts like
 * Encapsulation
 * Polymorphism
 * Inheritance
 * Abstraction
for application development.

Encapsulation:
 Encapsulation is binding operations (code) 
 and attributes (data) of an entity into 
 one respective unit.

 Example:
 class Stack
 {
  //data
  int data[];
  int top;

  //code
  void push(int) {...}
  int pop() {...}

 }//Stack

 FYI : Making a class is implementing encapsulation.


Polymorphism:
 Polymorphism is the ability of an object
 to perform a task in multiple ways.


 class Billing
 {
  void payment(card) {code 1}  
  void payment(cash) {code 2}  
  void payment(loyaltypoints) {code 3} 
 }


Inheritance:
 Inheritance is a mechanism that allows
 creation of derived entities from existing
 ones.
 The derived entites extend the behaviour.


 class Clock
 {
  int h,m,s;

  void setTime() {...}
  void displayTime() {...}
  void updateTime() {...}
 }

 class AlarmClock inherits Clock
 {
  //extensions 
  int ah, am;
  void setRingtone() {...}
  void playRingtone() {...}
  void snooze() {...} 
 }


Abstraction
 Abstraction is exposing operations of an
 object while hiding its implementation and
 sub operations.

 The user of the object knows what an
 object does but doesnt know how it does.


 class ShopKeeper
 {
  public sellCandy()
  {
    openJar();
    selectCandyColorwise();
    ...
  } 

  private openJar(){ ... }
  private selectCandyColorwise() {...}

 }

 By abstraction implementation 
 of objects behaviour may be 
 felexibly modified/upgraded. 


Platform Independence
--------------------------
Platform Independence is the ability of 
a binary file (compiled) to execute on 
multiple platforms (OS).

Q) Why a binary file becomes platform dependent?
A) A program (application) developed using 
a particular language (say C) uses the API 
(header files in case of C) provided by the 
respective language.

These API internally use/access OS API.

Hence on compilation the program becomes 
OS compatible and OS dependent.

Such compiled programs do not run on other OS.


Q) How a Java binary file becomes platform independent?
A) A program (application) developed using 
Java uses the Java API.

These API doesnt use/access OS API, rather 
uses or access features and functions provided 
by JVM (Java Virtual Machine).

On compilation a binary executable file
(called as bytecode) gets generated.

Such a compiled program is compatible to 
JVM and directly not to any OS.

Oracle Corp (Earlier Sun Microsystems) 
develops JVM's corresponding to every OS.

These JVM's get the "bytecode" of Java 
application, convert that into underlying 
OS compatible form and execute.

By this the Java program gets platform independence.
