Package
----------
A package is a collection of classes,interfaces and nested packages.

A package is used to form:
 * Java API
 * Java Applications (Project)

Creation
-------------
* To create a package, create a directory
of the same name as of the package.

* Define the necessary classes or interfaces 
with the package statement as their first
statement and store them in the package directory.

Usage
--------
If an application is made, then the package
is converted to a jar/war/ear for execution.

If an api is made, then the classes/interfaces
of the package are "imported" and readily used.


import
--------
import statement is used to get access of the
public classes and interfaces of a package.


To resolve import JVM uses the "CLASSPATH".
CLASSPATH is the list of "package locations".

For Windows:
 location1;location2;location3

For Linux:
 location1:location2:location3


CLASSPATH can be set in 2 ways:
 * OS level environment variable (a permanent list of package locations)
 * compile/execution option (a temporary list of package locations)


FYI
-----
If a java class is not put in any package then 
the system considers it to be in a no-name package 
that spans the current directory. 

The class can be directly used by other classes 
of the same directory but cannot be imported.
