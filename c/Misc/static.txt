static variable
--------------
Local and Global variables may be declared as "static".
A variable that is static gets the life equal to the life of the program.
It gets allocated in data segment of RAM as program starts.
It remains alive as long as the program is running.
Hence it can preserve data across calls to the function.
Being a variable, it may be overwritten / modified. 
It is garbage free by default.
