Preprocessor and Directives
---------------------------
Preprocessor is a compile time tool that
executes it directives to affect the source code.
After the preprocessor action, the compiler
converts the code into binary executable.

The preprocessor tool is represented by the symbol #
Its directives (commands) are:
 #include : To include the contents of a header file at the current place in the code.
 #define : To define a macro. A macro is a token replacement mechanism. All the occurrence of the macro are replaced by its value.
 #undef : To undefine a macro.

 Macro based conditional compilation:
 #ifdef : if a macro is defined
 #ifndef : if a macro is not defined
 #if : macro comparison
 #elif : macro comparison
 #else : an else to the above
 #endif : an endif to the above
