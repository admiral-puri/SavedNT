Storage Class Specifiers 
-----------------------
Storage class specifiers decide the allocation location of a variable.

An applications memory is divided into 4 segments
1) Code Segment  (code of the program)
2) Data Segement (global and static variables)
3) Heap Segment (dynamic memory allocation)
4) Stack Segment (local variables)

C supports 4 types of storage class specifiers.
1) auto
2) register
3) static
4) extern

auto
-------
auto is the default access specifier for local variables.
It makes the system allocate the local variable in Stack segment of RAM.
The variables get local life and usage.
The variable contain garbage by default.
It cannot be applied to global variables.

register
--------
register requests that the local variable being declared
possibly be allocated in CPU registers, instead of any 
segment of RAM.

This is done to optimize access.

If request is granted allocation will be done in CPU registers
otherwise the variable will be treated like an auto variable.


static
--------
Refer : static.c and static.png

extern
--------
extern specifies that the variable/function being
declared and used here (in this module) will be
defined in some external module that this module
is importing/including.
