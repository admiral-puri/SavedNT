Global Variables
---------------
A global variable is a variable that belongs to the program.
It has the life equal to the life of the program.
It gets allocated in data segment of RAM.
It is garbage free by default.
It can be used by all functions of the program.
It is used to share data across functions.

If a local variable takes the same name as of the
global variable then for the function the usage maps
with the local variable and the global variable gets
shadowed.
FYI
If a local variable takes the same name as
of a global variable then usage maps with the
local variable and the global hides (gets shadowed).
Hence avoid duplicating the names.
