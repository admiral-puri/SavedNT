Nested Loop
-------------- 
A nested loop is a loop inside a loop. 
For one cycle of the outer loop the inner (nested) loop executes completely. 

Types of nested loops
-------------------------

* A linear loop is a loop in which change in loop controlling factor is due to addition/subtration of units.
* A logarithmic loop in which change in loop controlling factor is due to multiplication or division.

Linear Logarithmic Loops: 
A nested loop in which outer loop is linear and inner loop is logarithmic or vice versa.
Hence number of iterations :
   f(n) = n* log(n) to the base multiplier or divisor

Quadratic : 
A nested loop in which outer and inner loop runs same (fixed) number of times.
Hence number of iterations :
   f(n) = n*n

Dependent Quadaratic : 
A nested loop in which outer loop is linear and inner loop is dependent for one of its factors.
Hence number of iterations :
   f(n) = n* (n+1)/2
