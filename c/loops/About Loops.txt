Loops
--------
Loops are mechanisms used to repeat
execution of a set of statements, as 
long as a governing condition is true.

Types
----------
C provides 3 types of loops:
1) for loop
2) while loop
3) do while loop

Loop design policy
------------------
1) Identify the statements to be repeated.
2) Decide the loop cycle count. 
In this way finalize : 
* Initialziation (start value).
* Reinitialization (change in value) 
* Condition (stop value)
3) Decide the type of loop.
* for (when loop cycles may be 0-many)
* while (when loop cycles may be 0-many)
* do while (when loop cycles may be 1-many)


Loop related terms
-------------------
Initialization : is assigning a start value to the loop controlling variable.
Condition : is the value at which the loop must stop.
Reinitialization : is the change in value of the loop controlling variable.


Loop control statements
-----------------------
break : break statement is used to terminate the current loop.

Syntax:
for loop
--------
      1)                     2),5),8)        4),7)
 for(INITIALIZATION; CONDITION; REINITIALIZATION)
 {//on true
  3),6) 
  code to repeated
 }
 //on false
 9)

while loop
----------
 INITIALIZATION
 while(CONDITION)
 {
  code to repeated
  REINITIALIZATION
 }

do while loop
-------------

INITIALIZATION
do
{
  code to repeated
  REINITIALIZATION
}CONDITION
