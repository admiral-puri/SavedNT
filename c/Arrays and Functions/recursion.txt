Recursion is a mechanism that allows
a function to invoke itself.

It must  be controlled using some
base condition, reaching which the
self invokation stops and recursion
unwinds.

If not controlled then due to usage
of a portion of stack space per invokation, 
the stack segment overflows causing
abnormal program termination.

It is used to solve certian mathematical
problems and for traversing hierarchical
content or data structures.
