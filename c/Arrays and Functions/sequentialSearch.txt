Sequential Search
-------------------
Sequential search finds a value across an array or a linked list (set).
It begins comparison of the value with the first element of the set.
It compares for equality.
Comparison progresses sequentially.
If a match is found, comparison stops with FOUND status.
If a match is not found, comparison stops at end of the set with a NOTFOUND status (-1 or NULL).
