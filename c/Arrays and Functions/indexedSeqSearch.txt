Indexed Sequential Search
-----------------------------
Indexed Sequential search finds a value across a sorted array or a sorted linked list (set).
It begins comparison of the value with the first element of the set.
It compares for equality and element being greater than value to be searched.
Comparison progresses sequentially.
If a match is found, comparison stops with FOUND status.
If a match is not found, comparison stops 
 *  at end of the set  
 *  at a value greater than the value to be searched 
with a NOTFOUND status (-1 or NULL).
