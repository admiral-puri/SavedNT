Datatypes
-----------
C classifies datatypes as :
* Primary 
* Secondary

Primary datatypes are the types predefined with the system.
They are ready for use.

Secondary datatypes are custom types tailor made for an application.
They are defined using struct or union.

Usage of the datatypes
-----------------------
C allows following ways for usage of a (primary or secondary) datatype.

* Through variable or object of the datatype. 
Example ( int i; Book b; Ahead use i and b)

* Through an array of the datatype. 
Example ( int iarr[3] ; Book barr[3]; Ahead use the array)

* Through a pointer of the datatype. 
Example ( int *ip ; Book *bp; Ahead use the pointers)

* As a functions return type.
Example:
   int fx1() {} 
   Book fx2() {}

============================================
struct 

A struct is a collection of hetrogenous data.
It is used to compose (form) real life entities,
example : Book, Time, Mouse, Camera, etc.

The data of the struct is a composition
of the attributes of the entity it represents.
