3) What is the life of a C program?
A) Life of a C program is defined by the main()
function. 
* System starts a C program with main().
* All code of main() and invoked from main() executes.
* As main() end program ends.

4) Can ++ or -- be applied on constants? Explain.
A) No. i.e. 10++ or --5 is illegal.
The operators are designed to act on variables.
Because internally x++ or ++x exands as x=x+1,
so 10++ would expand as 10=10+1 and a constant
on LHS of = is illegal. 

5) What is conditional branching?
A) Conditional branching is making system execute
one portion of code and skip the other or vice-versa.
C supports conditional branching using :
if statement, switch statement and ternary oeprator.
