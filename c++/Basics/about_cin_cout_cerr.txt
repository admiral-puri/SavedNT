A C++ program include the header file iostream
from which it gets:- cin, cout and cerr
The predefined objects that represent stdin, stdout 
and stderr respectively.

About cout 
------------
* cout is a global object defined in iostream.
* Its datatype is class ostream.
* It is auto initialized to refer to stdout.
* It supports use of operator << (insertion)
for outputting program data to stdout, which
ahead takes the data to the monitor.


About cerr
-------------
* cerr is a global object defined in iostream.
* Its datatype is class ostream.
* It is auto initialized to refer to stderr.
* It supports use of operator << (insertion)
for outputting program data to stderr, which
ahead takes the data to the monitor.

About cin
-------------
* cin is a global object defined in iostream.
* Its datatype is class istream.
* It is auto initialized to refer to stdin.
* It supports use of operator >> (extraction)
for fetching keyboard data via stdin.

Example:
 cin>>a;
 b = a*a;
 cout<<b;
