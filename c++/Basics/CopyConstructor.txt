When system needs to create a copy
of an object, as in case of pass
by value, then system uses a memory
copy method. 

It is a method that fetches every 
byte of the source and updates the 
target. 
So the target becomes a duplicate
of the source.
It is a shallow copy method.

If for an application shallow copy
works fine then the application can
continue as it is.

But if deep copy is required or
if the application wants to take
charge of creating duplicates of
an object then the application 
must define a "Copy Constructor".


A copy constructor is a special
constructor of the class that takes
a single parameter that should be
object of the same class received
by reference.

Known that when a constructor is
invoked then some object is under
creation. 
For a copy constructor that object 
is the destination of copy and the 
parameter object is the source of copy.
