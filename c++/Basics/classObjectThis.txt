Encapsulation
-----------------
Encapsulation is binding operations (code) and 
attributes (data) of an entity (class) into 
one unit.

In C++, defining a class is implementing encapsulation.

class
-------
A class is a collection of:
 * code (member functions)
 * data (member variables, arrays, pointers,...)
A class forms a custom secondary datatype.

Known that a datatype is used through its instances
so a class must be instantiated for use.
i.e. Its objects must be created and used.

object
---------
An object is an instance of a class.
It can store and process data.
Its storage ability is defined by the member variables of the class.
Its processing ability is defined by the member functions of the class.
It is mandatory for access the members of the class.

this
-----
this is a system defined formal parameter for member functions of the class.
It is a pointer to type current class.
It gets the address of the caller object of the function.
It is used to access the other members of the class.
It is a constant pointer that refers to the caller object of the function, it cannot be modified.
