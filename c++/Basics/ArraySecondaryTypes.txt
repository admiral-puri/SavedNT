Array of Secondary Types
-------------------------
In C++, data types can be classified as : 
1) Primary
2) Secondary
C++ allows creation of arrays of primary and secondary types.

Syntax:
  datatype arrName[arrSize];

Examples:
  int arr[10];
  Player team[11];
  Student batch[60];

For a primary datatype the array elements are variables of the type.

For a secondary datatype the array elements are objects of the type.

By default, the default constructor is invoked to initialize the array elements (objects).

Inorder to invoke the constructors of choice, an array initializer must be used.
Hence, object creation statement  updates as :

Myclass arr[3] = {Myclass(), Myclass(1,2), Myclass(11,22) };

In case the initializer hosts less number of constructor calls 
as compared to array size then for the remaining elements
(objects), the default constructor acts.

In case the initializer hosts constructor calls beyond array 
size then compile time warning or error would raise.


FYI
-------
One uses array of objects to facilitate  applications of algorithms.
