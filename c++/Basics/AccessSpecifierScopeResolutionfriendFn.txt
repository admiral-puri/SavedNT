Access Specifiers
---------------------
Access Specifiers (Modifiers) control
the usage of members of a class across
the program.

C++  provides 3 types of access specifiers:
1) private
2) protected
3) public

private
----------
Access specifier "private", limits
the usage of the member to current 
class only.
The "private" member is not accessible to:
 * Derived classes
 * Other classes
 * Non member functions

In C++, the members of a class are
by default "private".

protected
------------
Access specifier "protected", limits
the usage of the member to:
 * Current class
 * Derived classes

The "protected" member is not accessible to:
 * Other classes
 * Non member functions

public
---------
Access specifier "public" puts no limit
on the access of the member.
It is accessible across the program.
i.e. It can be accessed by:
 * Current class
 * Derived classes
 * Other classes
 * Non member functions




Scope Resolution Operator
----------------------------
C++ specifies that a class must
contain declarations only.
And the definitions of its member
functions, constructors, ... should
be provided outside the class.

When a member function, constructor, ...
is defined outside the class then
it resembles a non member.


To reflect that 
1) A function, constructor, ... is a member of the class, definition of which has been provided outside the class.
2) It is not a non member.
The signature is modified as follows:

Original:
 returnType fnName(parameters)
 {}

Updated:
 returnType className :: fnName(parameters)
 {}


Here operator :: is the scope resloution
operator which specifies that the current
member belongs to a particular class.




friend function
--------------------
A friend function is a non member
function that is granted access of
all the members of the class to which
it is set as a friend.
