Destructor
-------------
A Destructor is an object resource deallocater.
It is a special member of the class, that resembles a function.
Following are its specialities:
 * It has the same name as of the class and preceeded by a ~. It has no return type specification.
 * It is always parameterless. Hence it cannot be overloaded.
 * It auto executes as life of the object gets over. 
It must be used to free the resources allocated for and utilized by the object.


FYI
------
If a class doesnt define a destructor
then compiler would auto generate a 
default destructor with empty body.
It is defined to aid object deallocation process.
