Object Creation Process

Object creation is a two step process.
1) Memory Allocation.
2) Execution of the Constructor.


Memory Allocation
-----------------------
In memory, an object is a composite block defined
by a collection of non static data members of
the class.

Constructor
--------------
Constructor is an object initializer.
It is a special member that resembles a function.
It Signature has :
 a) Same name as of the class.
 b) No return type specification.
It is automatically invoked to execute as object of the class is created.
It is used to initialize the object.
 
Compiler support:
-----------------------
If for a class theres no constructor defined then 
the compiler would auto generate a public and default (parameterless) 
constructor with empty definition (body).
It allows object creation, but doesnt initialize the object members.

If a data member is initialized while declaration then 
the initialization staement is transferred into the constructors of the class.


Constructor Overloading
---------------------------
Constructor Overloading is defining multiple constructors for the class with unique set of parameters.
  
This allows object initialization in multiple ways.

Known that if an operation is possible in multiple ways then it is polymorphic.
So overloading constructors is implementing compile time polymorphism.
