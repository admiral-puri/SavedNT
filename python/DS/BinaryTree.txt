                  TREE

Definition
------------
A tree is a homogenous data structure.
It arranges its data in a hierarchical order.
The top of the hierarchy is marked by a root node. 
Then there are child nodes which further
have more child nodes.
Finally the nodes that mark the bottom portion 
i.e. the nodes that donot have any further child 
nodes are termed as leaf nodes.

A binary tree is a tree in which every node has: 
* 1 predecessor (exception is the root node)
* 0-2 successors.


Design
--------
A binary tree node has 3 parts :
 1) Pointer/Reference to the left child.
 2) Data
 3) Pointer/Reference to the right child.

In case the left or the right child doesnt
exist then the respective pointer or reference
is set as NULL.

Note : 
For a binary tree having n nodes there are 
n+1 NULL pointers.
