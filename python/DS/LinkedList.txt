A linked list is a collection of  homogenous data.

It stores its data in linearly arranged elements called as "nodes".

A node stores:
  * Data
  * Link to the next node

A linked list supports operations
like:
 * create
 * insert
 * delete
 * update
 * sort
 * count
 * search
 * many more as per custom needs.

The limitation of linked list
the traversal efficiency O(n)
because to reach node n, n hops
are required. 

Being sequential (linear) and homogenous
the linked list may be used for the same 
purpose as an array.

Advantage of linked list over an array
is the ability to expand or shrink in
size.

Advantage of an array over a linked 
list is direct access.
